# Fluent Calculator

The very first (and very naive) pass at a fluent calculator. It has a lot of duplication, unnecessary code, and ignores a lot of the more advanced Ruby features. Things can only get better from here.

It cannot operate on more than two numbers, and requires that we create a new instance of Calculator before performing any calculations.
